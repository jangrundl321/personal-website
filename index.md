I am a Computer Science Master’s student at the University of Rostock with a strong focus on **applied AI, software engineering, and responsible AI systems**. 

My work sits at the intersection of **technical rigor, explainability, and societal impact**, especially in high-stakes domains such as animal welfare, and education.

I am particularly interested in how AI systems can be designed so that they are not only performant, but also **understandable, trustworthy, and aligned with human and societal needs**.

In addition to research and development, I care deeply about **teaching, accessibility, and community engagement**. I believe technology should meaningfully improve lives—not just exist as an abstract capability.

## Volunteering & Engagement

- Volunteer Work at the Kampfkunstakademie Rostock 

I see volunteering as an essential counterbalance to technical and academic work—keeping my perspective grounded in real human needs.

## Values & Interests

- Responsible and human-centered AI  
- Explainable and trustworthy machine learning  
- Technology & society, AI governance, digital responsibility  
- Education, accessibility, and social good  

I like AI—but I like it even more when it genuinely helps people (and other living beings).
