title: "Im bored. So im doing Mini-Projects. Project #1: Building a Minimalist Kanban Board"
date: 2025-12-28
---

Hello!

As part of my new commitment to create small projects biweekly, I'm excited to share my first build: a **minimalist Kanban board** built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Why a Kanban Board?

I wanted to start with something practical—a tool I'd actually use. This Kanban board helps organize tasks across three columns: Backlog, In Progress, and Complete. It's simple, clean, and gets the job done without any unnecessary complexity.

## What I Built

The board features:
- **Drag-and-drop functionality** to move tasks between columns
- **IndexedDB persistence** so your tasks survive browser refreshes
- **Clean, minimalist design** with a light color scheme
- **Zero dependencies**—just pure frontend code

You can try it out here: [**Kanban Board**](../apps/kanban-board.html)

## The Biweekly Project Plan

This is the first of many small projects I'm planning to build over the coming months. The goal is simple: create something new every two weeks (at least!) until I either run out of time or run out of ideas—whichever comes first.

These projects will be a mix of practical tools, learning experiments, and maybe some fun creative pieces. The key is to keep shipping, keep learning, and not overthink it. ( And because im bored! :) )

Some ideas I'm considering for future projects:
- A markdown note-taking app
- A habit tracker
- Interactive data visualizations
- Small games or coding challenges
- a learning plattform using old materials from my tutoring job at Juniorstudium Rostock

I'll be documenting each project here on my website, sharing what I learned and the thought process behind each build.
