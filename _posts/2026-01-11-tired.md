Hey everyone 👋

Wow… what a week. And honestly, it feels like the next few weeks are going to be just as packed. I’m tired, a bit overwhelmed, but also **super excited**. Here’s a quick recap of what’s been happening and what’s coming up.  

## Studentische Unternehmensberatung e.V. in Rostock

Some friends and I are **planning to join the student consulting club in Rostock**. I’m really looking forward to learning from real projects, gaining practical experience, and just seeing how student-run consulting actually works.  

## Byte Challenge Update

I had my **first group meeting at Byte Challenge** — and already got involved in some tasks!  
I’ll probably do a **small course on Computer Vision** soon, and I’m going “old school” by doing it **without neural networks**. Feels nostalgic, and it’s exciting to teach some fundamentals in a hands-on way.  

## Ossinity – First Real Meeting Coming Up

Next week I have my **first official meeting at Ossinity**. I’ll meet my **team and actual boss**, and hopefully finalize my **contract**. Super excited to see the project in action and start contributing in a real, structured way.  

## Volunteering – Still Exploring Options

The **local volunteer study tutors** haven’t gotten back to me yet.  
On the bright side, someone else reached out about a **LawTech NGO project**, where they train LLMs to understand legal texts for non-native speakers.  
I’ve also contacted a few other organizations — so nothing is fixed yet. I really want to **volunteer locally**, but if I don’t find something appropriate or exciting, I’ll probably stick to **remote volunteering**.  
Oh, and I also created a **UN volunteer account** — who knows what opportunities might pop up there!  

## Side Projects: BrainBuddies

I also started working on a **side project called BrainBuddies**. It’s supposed to be an **edu-tech platform with a gamified twist**. I’ll save the full story for later, but it’s exciting to start something new and see where it goes.  

## TL;DR: A Crazy Week

Honestly, it felt like I did **a month of work in just one week**. Exams, meetings, volunteering, side projects… it’s a lot. But I’m **hyped**, tired in the best way, and can’t wait to see what the next few weeks bring.  

Stay tuned for updates — probably more chaos, coffee, and exciting new things! 🚀
