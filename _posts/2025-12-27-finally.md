Happy Holidays! 🎉  

As we step into 2026, I’m feeling inspired to take my ideas for engagement and learning to the next level. This year, I want to focus more on giving back to our local communities here in Rostock, especially by supporting education and mentorship for disadvantaged kids.  

One of my main goals is to **teach and mentor young learners**, helping them discover the joy of math and computer science. I’ve been thinking about creating a **dedicated teaching website** that starts with fun math and AI concepts for kids and gradually grows into more advanced topics. The idea is to make learning accessible, interactive, and engaging for everyone, no matter their background.  

On a personal note, I’m also excited to finally have my **own personal website** up and running! It’s been a long time coming, and this site will be my platform to share ideas, projects, tutorials, and updates on my teaching and mentoring initiatives.  

Here’s to a year full of learning, community engagement, and new beginnings. I can’t wait to see where these projects will go—and I hope you’ll join me on this journey!
