title: "Reality Check: Slowing Down the Mini-Projects (For Good Reasons)"
date: 2026-01-03

Hello again 👋

So… a small (but important) update on the whole *biweekly mini-projects* idea.

Short version: I might need to **slow down or pause the mini-projects earlier than expected** — not because I lost motivation, but because *a lot of other things suddenly started happening*.

## Exams, Uni, and Real Life™️

First of all: **exam season is coming up**, and university + work officially start again on **January 5th**. That alone already changes how much free time and mental energy I realistically have. I still like the idea of small projects, but forcing a strict two-week cadence during exams would probably do more harm than good.

## Volunteering at Byte Challenge (GI e.V.)

One really exciting thing: I recently started **volunteer work at Byte Challenge**, a project by the *Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.*

I’m involved as:
- tester  
- author of learning materials  
- contributor to learning courses  

And yes — **everything is completely free for kids**, which is honestly one of the best parts. Being able to contribute to accessible computer science education feels way more meaningful than shipping yet another side project just for the sake of it.

## Coursera Speedruns (Because €42/month? No thanks)

I also went on a bit of a **Coursera speedrun spree** recently — mostly because I really didn’t want to pay **€42 per month** longer than necessary.

Some of the topics I covered:
- a bit of **project management**
- **data privacy**
- Google’s course on **Responsible AI**
- …and somehow **WordPress tutorials** (no idea why, but here we are)

Not all of it is directly useful right now, but it definitely broadened my perspective and gave me some new ideas.

## Writing on Medium & Other Experiments

I also started **writing on Medium** about more or less random stuff — learning experiences, tech thoughts, and whatever feels worth sharing.

I might also experiment a bit more with **other social media content** if I have the time. No pressure, no fixed plan — just trying things out and seeing what sticks.

## Local Volunteering (Maybe 👀)

Another idea I’m genuinely excited about: volunteering **locally as a mentor or tutor for disadvantaged kids**.

Nothing is fixed yet, and I want to see how everything else develops first — but it’s something I’d really like to do if the opportunity fits.

## So… What About the Mini-Projects?

I’m not abandoning the idea. I still love building small things and shipping them.

But instead of:
> *every two weeks, no matter what*

It’s probably going to be more like:
> *when time, energy, and curiosity align*

And honestly, that feels healthier.

It’s kind of exciting to do more things, explore different directions, and see where it all leads — even if that means slowing down in one area to make room for others.

More updates soon (probably).
